# Senior-Design-Project
This repository is the final iteration of files used for the 2024-2025 A.I.M.S. Team Senior Design Project files. This project was a 6 Degree of Freedom Articulated Robotic Arm. The code presented in this folder was all created or facilitated by Ian Hunt, a Univserity of North Texas Graduate.

The project focused on developing a six degrees of freedom (6DOF) articulated robotic arm. This project integrates embedded systems, real-time control, and computer vision using a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu with ROS (Robot Operating System). Features include manual and pre-programmed movement control via a custom UI, real-time video feedback from an onboard camera, and collaborative software-hardware integration. In this project, we used ROS 2 Jazzy, running on Ubuntu 24.04 Noble Numbat. The folder in this repository was the source folder of all non-auto-generated code in the ROS 2 workspace that we used in the project.

The project was assisted and funded by University of North Texas and Anora Labs.
